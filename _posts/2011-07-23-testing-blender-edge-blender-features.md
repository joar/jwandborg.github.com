I have been trying out the GSoC Tomato branch of blender. The branch
features a brand-new camera tracking feature presented over at [Blender Cookie](http://www.blendercookie.com/2011/07/14/gsoc-tomato-branch-camera-tracking/).

It allows you to easily create a 3D space based on control points in any movie clip, place your objects in that space and render it.

This is my first go at it:
